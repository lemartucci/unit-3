        <h1> Agricultural Practices in New York State (2017)</h1></div>
    <div class = "column">
    <p>Agriculture is an important component to New York state's economy with almost 7 million acres in production contributing 
        almost 6 billion dollars in revenue in 2017(nyfb.org). Agricultural operations in New York are diverse, ranging from dairy operations, 
        apple orchards, to vegetable farms, each utilizing their own set of agricultural practices to manage their farm land. Understanding which agricultural practices are most utilized across the state can provide
        insight into agricultural trends by region and allow for evalutation of their environmental impact and sustainability.
        </p>
    <p>This interactive map illustrates 8 different agricultural practices by county: Alley Cropping & Silvopasture, Cover Cropping, No Tillage, Conventional Tillage, Tile Drainage, Artifical Ditch Drainage, Rotation/Intensive Grazing, and farms with a Conservation Easement.
        The data collected by the USDA in 2017 is by farm; therefore, the unit of each practice is farms. Below are brief definitions of each practice depicted:
    </p>
        <p>
        <b>Alley Cropping</b> relates to planting rows of trees within agricultural fields and planting crops between those rows.
        <b>Silvopasture</b> relates to incorporating trees and livestock grazing in the same pasture. 
        <b>Cover Cropping</b> is the practice of growing non-cash crops to keep the soil covered in order to reduce erosion; these are typically planted between cash crop harvests. 
        <b>No tillage</b> is the practice of not implementing soil disturbance in order to minimize soil disruption, while 
        <b>Conventional Tillage</b> disrupts the soil in order to prepare seedbeds and manage weeds. Conventional tillage can increase soil erosion and soil compaction.<b>Rotational/Intensive Grazing</b> involves
        moving grazing livestock from field to field to allow grazed fields to recover and regrow. 
        <b>Artifical Ditch Drainage</b> drains/redirects groundwater via manmade channels; this is important for preventing flooding and reduced soil aeration in agricultural fields.
        <b>Tile Drainage</b> is a drainage sysetm below the field that collects and removes excess subsurface water; this is important for soil aeration in agricultural fields. 
        A <b>Conservation Easement</b> is a voluntary legal agreement that protects the land from development.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Counties shaded in grey do not have data because it was not reported in the census.</p>
